## Elastic Search
* Elasticsearch provides an interface to browse through the clusters, indexes and data which can be accessed using the URL http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head.

Elastic Search supports clustering. So, you can have three different elastic search instances work in a co-ordinated manner without any admin intevention.

Every record inserted in Elasticsearch is called a Document which is associated with a unique identifier called Document Id. You can map the database identity of corresponding record to the document Id. This will help bridge the gap between Elasticsearch data and data stored in database at a few functional points. If you donâ€™t map the Document Id, Elasticsearch associates the document with a self-generated unique identifier.
