Apache Camel is an open source Java framework that focuses on making integration easier and more accessible to developers. It does this by providing:
* concrete implementations of all the widely used Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs)
* connectivity to a great variety of transports and APIs
* easy to use Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) to wire EIPs and transports together
